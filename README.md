# RoadLaneDetection-UdacityCarND-P1 Readme
 This is first project of Self Driving Car NanoDegree course from Udacity. This project uses OpenCV to detect lanes from a video stream and mark it on the video.
 
 ## Usage details
 carnd-term1 environment needs to be activated before you can open P1.pynb. Refer [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) and [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-LaneLines-P1) for getting this set-up.
 
 Now, activate the environment using `source activate carnd-term1`

 
 Git clone the repository for downloading a local version on to your system. You can use `git clone` command to do this
  
  ```
     git clone git@github.com:sujithjose5/RoadLaneDetection-UdacityCarND-P1.git
     cd RoadLaneDetection-UdacityCarND-P1
     jupyter notebook P1.pynb
  ```

This would open up the jupyter notebook and you will be able to run the commands. It take image inputs from sample images in the home directory and outputs to another directory in the same location. 

Please let me know if you come across any troubles. I will be more than happy to help you out.

Have fun!
